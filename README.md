This is a distributed web application that supports functionality resembling that of an e-commerce domain, built using Docker.

To run this application on your local machine, you must have Docker installed. Once docker is running,
open a terminal, navigate to the project's root folder where 'docker-compose.yml' is located, and run the 
following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After the application has finished building, open up a browser and visit 'localhost/' to access it.

# Docker
The architecture of the distributed application presented in this repo, is defined inside a docker-compose.yml file 
that's located in the project's root folder. This file contains all the nessecary instructions for docker to automatically 
pull the required images from dockerhub and build the containers using the specified architecture of the project. 

Due to this reason, the first time you run docker-compose it might take a while for the application to load. 
Here is a scheme of the architecture used:

![Application Architecture](https://github.com/pkalaitzakis/e-commerce-web-app/blob/main/architecture.png?raw=true)

# Front-End Client
Anyone can sign up on the application by filling out the registration form under 'localhost/index.php'. 
Through this form, visitors specify the role they wish to have in the app as well as provide some personal information.

In order to successfully log in, account owners must provide a correct set of credentials (email & password),
and also be confirmed (enabled) by an active administrator prior to the login action. 

The following set of credentials of three dummy accounts, each assigned a 
different role in the app, can be used for a quick login:

| Email | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin@test.com` | `abc123456@` | Administrator |
| `merchant@test.com` | `abc123456@` | Merchant |
| `user@test.com` | `abc123456@` | User |

Users need to be 'Confirmed' in order to be granted the permissions to access their respective role features. Administrators are responsible for confirming users through the administration.php page of the application.

# FIWARE's Keyrock Identity Management Service
User authentication and authorization is implemented by utilizing FIWARE's identity management service. In short, Keyrock is a FIWARE sevice that allows a website provider (super-admin) to register their domain as an Application, and maintain a set of Roles (usergroups) with different Permissions regarding access to that application's resources. To this end, another docker container running MySQL is required for storing data detrimental to Keyrock's internal architecture. Each user's registration data is also stored inside the auto-generated IDM database, under the 'description' column of the 'users' table, by seperating each field with a ', ' delimiter. If you plan on fiddling with the Keyrock gui under localhost:3005, just to see how everything is setup, be mindful that if the user description field is altered, the administration page of the front-end client might show unexpected behaviour. FIWARE provides a pre-built REST API that is utilized for communicating with Keyrock service while browsing the application, by forwarding HTTP requests to it with cURL in PHP.

Upon successfully logging in, each user receives an OAuth2 token generated by Keyrock, which will remain valid until the newly initiallized php session is manually destroyed (logging out). This token is cached in the PHP $_SESSION global variable array, along other useful user info retrieved from the response of the application's logic container for later usage.

# FIWARE'S Wilma PEP Proxy Service
Wilma PEP Proxy service acts as an intermediate protection layer between a client making requests to other backend services, by challenging the requesting client's rights. For authorization to occur, the header of the request must contain the OAuth2 token provided during login. The token is cross referenced with the Roles & Permissions configured using Keyrock, and based on those configurations Wilma decides whether the request should be forwarded to the target backend service.

# Data Storage (MongoDB REST-API)
Application data (with the exception of users' personal information, roles, permissions, etc., stored in Keyrock) is being stored in a seperate MongoDB container and can be accessed by sending appropriate requests to this particular service. Data Storage is hosted by a standalone apache server that runs php code that converts HTTP requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) into appropriate queries to a NoSQL MongoDB database. This service is protected by Wilma PEP Proxy.


# Application Logic
A seperate Docker container hosting an apache server that runs php code and acts as a request/response forwarding center for the front-end client. Every time a resource is requested at the front-end side (WebApp), a request is made to this domain where it gets forwarded to the container running the target service (Keyrock, Data Storage, etc).

# Pending implementations
### FIWARE'S Orion Context Broker
- Utilize the service's REST api to create a PUB/SUB mechanism that informs users about their cart items being withdrawn/restocked 
by their sellers. 
- Adjust welcome page to show update feed from orion for a certain period of time.
